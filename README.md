# BioMedPingUtility

A simple PowerShell health‚Äëcheck script for biomedical devices that verifies:

1. Wired NIC status (ignores Wi‚ÄëFi/Wireless)  
2. Local IP, Subnet Mask & Default Gateway  
3. ICMP ping to the default gateway  
4. ICMP ping to a hard‚Äëcoded server (8.8.8.8)  
5. TCP port test to the server on port‚ÄØ443

Please change the IP and ports based on your requirement, the given IP address and port is for demonstration purpose only..

Based on the results, it displays one of three scenarios with clear next‚Äëstep instructions.

## Prerequisites

- Windows PowerShell (v5.1 or later)  


---

## Installation

1. Copy **BioMedPingUtility.ps1** to your scripts folder (e.g. `D:\scripts`).  
2. Ensure execution policy allows script running:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
   
## Usage
```powershell
PS D:\scripts> .\BioMedPingUtility.ps1
```
No parameters required ‚Äî server and port are hard‚Äëcoded.

## Output Scenarios

### Scenario 1: All Connectivity Success ‚Äì Clinical Apps Attention Needed
```text
Local IP Address : 192.168.8.7
Subnet Mask       : 255.255.255.0
Default Gateway   : 192.168.8.1

Pinging default gateway (192.168.8.1)‚Ä¶
‚úÖ Default gateway is reachable.

Pinging server (8.8.8.8)‚Ä¶
‚úÖ Server '8.8.8.8' is reachable.

Testing TCP port 443 on '8.8.8.8'‚Ä¶
‚úÖ TCP port 443 on '8.8.8.8' is OPEN.

üéâ All connectivity checks passed! If the device is still not working, please contact your Clinical Application Team.
```
### Scenario 2: Network OK but Server Port Blocked
```text
‚Ä¶gateway & server pings succeed‚Ä¶

Testing TCP port 443 on '8.8.8.8'‚Ä¶
‚ùå TCP port 443 on '8.8.8.8' is CLOSED or FILTERED.

‚úÖ Server '8.8.8.8' is reachable. However, connectivity on port 443 cannot be established. Please contact your Network Team with this screenshot.
```
### Scenario 3: Network Failure
```text
Pinging default gateway (192.168.8.1)‚Ä¶
‚ùå Default gateway is NOT reachable.

Pinging server (8.8.8.8)‚Ä¶
‚ùå Server '8.8.8.8' is NOT reachable.

‚ùå Default gateway or server is not reachable. Please contact your Network Team with this screenshot.
```
## Customization

- To target a different server or port, edit the ``$Server`` and ``$TestPort`` variables at the top of the script.  
- To allow parameterized input instead of hard‚Äëcoding, replace those variables with a ``param()`` block.
